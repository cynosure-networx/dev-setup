# Cynosure Networx Dev Machine Setup

This is the guide for setting up a new development computer at Cynosure Networx.

We develop primarily PHP applications using Laravel and hybrid mobile applications using Ionic Framework.  This guide was created following the works of [Sourabh Bajaj](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/index.html "Sourabh Bajaj").  It has been tweaked to serve our purposes.
